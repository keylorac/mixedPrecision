# Work Plan to Include Mixed Precision in the Project

## Month 1 (April 26 - May 25): Learn the Basics
- Research what Mixed Precision is and what it is used for.
- Understand the differences between types of precision: FP32 (single), FP64 (double), FP16 (half).
- Read simple examples of Mixed Precision in computing programs.

## Month 2 (May 26 - June 25): First Tests
- Create a program that calculates propagators using only full precision (FP64).
- Test that the program works correctly.
- Modify parts of the program to use single precision (FP32) and compare results.
- Note if the program runs faster or uses less memory.

## Month 3 (June 26 - July 25): Improve and Analyze
- Identify where low precision can be used without losing good result quality.
- Measure the execution time and memory usage in different tests.
- Learn to use tools to see where the program spends more time.

## Month 4 (July 26 - August 25): Apply it to the Real Problem
- Use the knowledge gained to perform propagator contractions.
- Ensure that using Mixed Precision does not significantly change physical results.
- If there are precision problems, correct them by adjusting where high precision is used.

## Month 5 (August 26 - September 25): Write and Organize Everything
- Write a simple report explaining what was done.
- Show comparisons of time and precision.
- Include graphs if possible.

## Month 6 (September 26 - October 25): Test and Present
- Conduct final tests on a large computer if available.
- Prepare a presentation or a small article.
- Share what was achieved and how Mixed Precision helped.
